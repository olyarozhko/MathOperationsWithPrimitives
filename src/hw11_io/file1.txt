Introduction

When programming, whether you're creating a mobile app, a web application, or just writing scripts,
you often have the need to read or write data to a file. This data could be cache data, 
data you retrieved for a dataset, an image, or just about anything else you can think of.

In this tutorial, we are going to show the most common ways you can read and write to files in Java.

Java provides several API (also known as Java I/O) to read and write files since its initial releases. 
With subsequent releases, Java I/O has been improved, simplified and enhanced to support new features.

Before we get in to some actual examples, it would help to understand the classes available to you that will 
handle the reading and writing of data to files. In the following sections we'll provide a brief overview of the Java I/O classes 
and explain what they do, then we'll take a look at Java NIO Streams, and finally we'll show some examples of reading and writing data to files.
